# Class & Object

## Constructor

- A constructor is a special type of member function that is called automatically when an object is created.

```cpp

          class  Class_name {
               public:
                  // create a constructor
                  Class_name() {
                      // code
                  }
                };

```

- The constructor has the same name as the class.

- It is always public.

- It has no return type not even void.

- It is automatically called whenever an object is created.
