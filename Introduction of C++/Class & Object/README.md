## Class & Object

### Constructor

- A constructor is a special type of member function that is called automatically when an object is created.

          class  Wall {
               public:
                  // create a constructor
                  Wall() {
                      // code
                  }
                };

  - The constructor has the same name as the class.

  - It is always public.

  - It has no return type not even void.

  - It is automatically called whenever an object is created.
