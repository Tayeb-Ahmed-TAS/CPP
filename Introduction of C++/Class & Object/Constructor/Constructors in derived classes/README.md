## Constructors in Derived Classes

- We can use constructors in derived classes in C++

- If base class constructor does not have any arguments, there is no need of any constructor in derived class.

- But if there are one or more arguments in the base class constructor, derived class need to pass arguments to the base class constructor.

- If both base class and derived class have constructors, base class constructor is executed first.
