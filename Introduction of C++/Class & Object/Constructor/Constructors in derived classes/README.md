## Constructors in Derived Classes

- We can use constructors in derived classes in C++

- If base class constructor does not have any arguments, there is no need of any constructor in derived class.

- But if there are one or more arguments in the base class constructor, derived class need to pass arguments to the base class constructor.

- If both base class and derived class have constructors, base class constructor is executed first.

## Constructors in Multiple Inheritance

- In multiple inheritance, base classes are constructed in the order in which they appear in the class declaration.

## Constructors in Multilevel Inheritance

- In multilevel inheritance, the constructors are executed in the order of inheritance.

## Special Syntax

- C++ supports a special syntax for passing arguments to multiple base classes

- The constructor of the derived class receives all the arguments at once and then will pass the call to the respective base classes

- The body is called after the constructors is finished executing

## Syntax

        Derived-Constructor (arg1, arg2, arg3â€¦.): Base 1-Constructor (arg1,arg2), Base 2-Constructor(arg3,arg4)
        {

        . . . . . . .

        } Base 1-Constructor (arg1,arg2)

## Special Case of Virtual Base Class

- The constructors for virtual base classes are invoked before a non-virtual base class

- If there are multiple virtual base classes, they are invoked in the order declared

- Any non-virtual base class are then constructed before the derived class constructor is executed
