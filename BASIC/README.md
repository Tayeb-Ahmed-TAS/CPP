## Basic

### Program Structure :

- The ```#include``` statement is used to add a header file to the program.
- The ```using``` command is used to tell the program which namespace to use.
- To use the ```cout``` command, you need to include the ```<iostream>``` header and use the ```std``` namespace.
- The starting point of C++ programs is the function called ```main```, which includes the code that you want to run.
- The ```endl``` command is used to add a new line to the output.

### Variables :

- Every program works with values.

- A variable lets you store a **value** by assigning it to a **name**. The name can be used to refer to the value later in the program.
