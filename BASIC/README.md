## Basic

### Program Structure :

- The `#include` statement is used to add a header file to the program.

- The `using` command is used to tell the program which namespace to use.

- To use the `cout` command, you need to include the `<iostream>` header and use the `std` namespace.

- The starting point of C++ programs is the function called `main`, which includes the code that you want to run.

- The `endl` command is used to add a new line to the output.

### Variables :

- Every program works with values.

- A variable lets you store a **_value_** by assigning it to a **_name_**. The name can be used to refer to the value later in the program.

- To declare a variable use the type followed by the name of the variable.

- You can assign a value to the declared variable using the = operator.

- A variable can change its value during the program, by being assigned to a new value.
